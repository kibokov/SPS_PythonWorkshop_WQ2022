# SPS "Python for Research" Workshop, Winter Quarter 2022

Instructional Materials for the second iteration of UChicago Society of Physics Students' Python workshop series. The goal of the workshop series is to help complete beginners get a basic handle on coding in the context of Physics and adjacent fields, in hopes of lowering this barrier to entry into undergraduate research. Absolutely no prior coding or Python experience required - we'll start from the very beginning - installation - and work our way up to more complex topics and ultimately final projects.

 Currently under development. Questions? Contact: Will Cerny (willcerny@gmail.com) and Viraj Manwadkar (virajmanwadkar@gmail.com)
